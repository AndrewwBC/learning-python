Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), 
Brian May (guitar, vocals), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), 
later joined by John Deacon (bass). 
Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually 
ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, 
such as arena rock and pop rock.
